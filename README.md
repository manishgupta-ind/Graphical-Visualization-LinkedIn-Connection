Graphical Visualization of LinkedIn Connection

We all use LinkedIn to make connections with professionals in our industry or even from any other industry too. On LinkedIn, we see only a list of our connections, so itâ€™s hard to visualize the entire network of your connections. I tried to apply my python skill in Data Science to explore my connections on LinkedIn and find out some interesting information and visualize it in the form of graph.

Graphs are one of the most important data structures that is applied in many real-world solutions. One of them is social networks. This really looks exciting. We will be creating a network that connects you to all the companies from your connections.
